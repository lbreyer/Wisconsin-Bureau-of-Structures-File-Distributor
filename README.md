# Wisconsin-Bureau-of-Structures-File-Distributor
The Bureau of Structures (BOS) in-house tool for distributing, modifying, and maintaining software and project files.

Project Description:

The Wisconsin Department of Transportationâ€™s (WisDOT) Bureau of Structures must constantly update and maintain a large inventory of computer resources for use by employees in the service of various department projects. A significant part of this process is updating and deploying the appropriate software to employee computers. The Bureau of Structures has a number of applications that fill this role, and this particular application, the WiBS File Distributor, is used primarily for deploying project and team specific files to applicable members.

The WiBS File Distributor provides a straight-forward file management tool for use by group administrators and project leaders to upload and deploy file packages their team members might require directly to their file bases. It draws upon distributable copies of deployment files through a centralized authentication gateway in order to then copy those files into the directories of PC's stored and maintained in the Computer Resources Inventory as referenced by the WiBS Computer Navigator tool.

My Role:

For this project, I functioned as the primary backend developer in order to refactor and update the application focusing mainly on refactoring the overall structural architecture of the application's code into a version of MVC framework designed for Windows Forms Apps along with updating and streamlining existing functionality.

The goal of reorganizing the code structure in this update was to divide the concerns of the project into the MVC components. By doing this, we allow for simplification of simultaneous development through separation of components with the hope of improving scalability as we further expand the application's functionality going forward.

Beyond refactoring the application into a more scalable model, I rebuilt the app's backend with the goal of reducing code redundancies, trimming unnecessary functionality, and improving overall efficiency. I updated the app's authentication connections and used the opportunity to develop overall programming efficiency.
